The Great Yoga Wall History

Based on the principles of alignment, ‘the wall’ is used as a prop to deepen yoga postures by opening and creating space in the body using therapeutic techniques.  The original “Yoga Wall” took on the form of ropes attached to wall hooks, designed by B.S. Iyengar. Overtime, the Yoga Wall has been modernized for greater comfort with the use of a new system of comfortable harnesses, supportive bars, and adjustable straps to accommodate all body-types. The Great Yoga Wall™ was invented in the early 1980’s, by Kedric Wolfe. His passion led to a “better way” to use the wall, with simple versatility. The wall is perfect for a beginner that needs extra support for balance or an advanced yogi who wants to use gravity to deepen their experience. Students with injuries or limitations find the Yoga Wall provides additional support as well as freedom in the joints and muscles, promoting healing and relief.
