Advanced Chakra Balancing -  There are 7 main energy centers in the body, known as chakras.  During your tailored session, you will discover things you didn't know were holding you back.  We will incorporate a combination of Stones, Aromatherapy ,and  Reiki to assist in healing.  Reiki is an energy based technique commonly called palm or hands on healing, which allows for self-healing and a state of equilibrium.  Through the use of this technique, practitioners transfer universal energy (i.e., Reiki) in the form of qi (Japanese: ki) through the palms, which allows for self-healing and a state of equilibrium. During the chakra balancing session, it's the practitioner's aim to invite the client into an environment that is free of all worldly stresses. You will start your treatment with a discussion to pin-point the areas of stress or emotional turmoil in your life. Each person is given a chakra balancing treatment plan that is individualized to treat their specific physical, emotional and spiritual well-being. This may include one or more of the relaxation techniques mentioned above. Your practitioner will also likely give you exercises that you can practice at home on your own.
